# Text Classification
My Btech thesis focuses on the identification of sexual harasment victims on Twitter and their portrayal from a computational linguistic perspective. This project is essentially a text classification problem and some models I explored while working on this are:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification
   After considerable success with images, CNNs have become increasingly popular in classic NLP tasks like Text Classification.The paper shows a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks built on top of word2vec. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, a simple CNN with one layer of convolution performs remarkably well.
   
2. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification

3. Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification
This paper shows a simple baseline using fasttext that is at par with deep learning methods.

4. Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification

5. An Embarrassingly Simple Approach for Transfer Learning from Pretrained Language Models
   This presents a conceptually simple and effective transfer learning approach that addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting. It is based on pretraining a LM and transferring its weights to a classifier with a taskspecific layer. The model is trained using a taskspecific functional with an auxiliary LM loss.Performs very well in small dataset oriented text classification tasks, especially Twitter domain.
   
6. Multi-label Categorization of Accounts of Sexism using a Neural Framework
